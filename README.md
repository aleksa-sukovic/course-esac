# Embedded Systems & Control

This repository is an implementation of the midterm assignment for the *Embedded Systems & Control* course held by [Martina Maggio](https://www.martinamaggio.com/main/) ([Saarland Informatics Campus](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de), [Lund Department of Automatic Control](http://control.lth.se)).

The implementation was extracted from my course repository, which I cannot share without exposing all of the materials and exercises, which is unfortunately not allowed.
